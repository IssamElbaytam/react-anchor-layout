## Motivation
Handle layout or positioning is always not a happy thing for me, even with flexbox.

The Anchor Positioning System of Qt Quick feels nicer to manage the problem. The goal of this project is to implement something similar to the anchors in Qt Quick.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Positioning with x, y-axis
- [ ] Anchor fill
- [ ] Anchor center
- [ ] Anchor top, right, bottom, left
